# Ensemble-learning-for-PDAC-early-detection


This code helps replicating the main results of the paper available at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.02.21267187v2 

It helps generating each base-learner and the stacking strategy with joined time-groups (JTG2L) with over-sampling of the minority class and synthetic data generation with HD-DPM or SMOTE are available.

A simple script is also provided for model-agnostic feature importance generation and enrichment analysis.

See Methods section in the paper for further details.
